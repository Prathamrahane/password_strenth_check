# password_strenth_check
Objective: Develop a program that analyzes the strength of user passwords based on certain criteria.

Steps:

Define Password Criteria: Determine the criteria for a strong password, such as minimum length, inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and avoidance of common dictionary words.

User Input: Prompt the user to enter a password.

Implement Password Strength Analysis: Create a function that analyzes the password based on the defined criteria. Assign a score to the password, taking into account the presence or absence of various elements (e.g., uppercase letters, numbers, special characters).

Provide Feedback: Provide feedback to the user about the strength of their password. Display the score and a message indicating whether the password meets the defined criteria for a strong password.

Optional Enhancement: You can extend the project by implementing additional features, such as suggesting password improvements or generating a random strong password for the user.
